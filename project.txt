Use regression models to predict the price of a car

Models: Linear Regression

Dependent Variable: "Price"


 *Are body attributes like weight and wheelbase or engine attributes better predictors of a cars price.

Independent Variables #1: "wheelbase	carlength	carwidth	carheight	curbweight" 
Independent Variables #2: "enginesize  boreratio  stroke  compression ratio  horsepower citympg highwaympg peakrpm"


* Create Two Scatter matricies 1) Body attributes with "Price" 2) Engine attributes with "Price"

* Create a correlation matrix heat map 
    - Filter for varibles with moderate-to-strong linear correlation coefficient

* Scale data
