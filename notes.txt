Use regression models to predict the price of a car

Models: Linear Regression

Dependent Variable: "Price"


 *Are body attributes like weight and wheelbase or engine attributes better predictors of a cars price.

Independent Variables #1: "wheelbase	carlength	carwidth	carheight	curbweight" 
Independent Variables #2: "enginesize  boreratio  stroke  compression ratio  horsepower citympg highwaympg peakrpm"


* Create Two Scatter matricies 1) Body attributes with "Price" 2) Engine attributes with "Price"

* Create a correlation matrix heat map 
    - Filter for varibles with moderate-to-strong linear correlation coefficient

* Scale data 


**** Updated Notes  ******

[Using the updated prompt]

Ideas:
    - There are 14 numerical variables. I will start by splitting the dataframe in half and select the variables from each half to build the final model.
    -     

Notes:

    - Enginesize, Horsepower, and Curbweight have the strongest correlation coefficients.(all positively correlated)
    - Carwidth, and carlength have a modarately positive correlation.
    - citympg and highwaympg have modarately negative correlation coefficients. 

    - *** With Price Outliers Removed: - Curbweight has the strongest correlation coefficient. Horsepower, enginesize, carheight, and car length all have
                                        modaratly postive correlations with price.
                                       - citympg and highwaympg have modarately negative correlations with price.
